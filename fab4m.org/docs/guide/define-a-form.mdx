# Creating forms

A form consists of *Components*. A component can be anything, but usually it's
a form field like a text field, but it can also be just a block of text.

Each component have a few common properties, like the name, label and the description.
See the [component reference](/guide/component-reference) for details.

## Forms for data input

Fabform provides components for most kinds of data input. The following example demonstrates a form
with text, email, url and boolean data.

<Example source={FormFieldsSource} example={<FormFields />} />

## Handling multiple data

Any component can be defined as a multiple compnent, which means that instead of just collecting one result, an array with results will be collected.

<Example source={MultipleFieldsSource} example={<MultipleFields />} />

## Grouping data together

If you have a complex form you might need to group several fields together in a group. Fab4m makes this possible through the `group` component. When you define your group component you also add all the child components to the group.

Each group component you add will be represented as an object in your submitted data. As with all other components, group components can have multiple values.

<Example source={GroupedComponentsSource} example={<GroupedComponents />} />

## Page breaks

Large forms can be split up into multiple parts. This is done using the `pageBreak`
component. All data will be validated before each page break.

<Example source={PageBreaksSource} example={<PageBreaks />} />
