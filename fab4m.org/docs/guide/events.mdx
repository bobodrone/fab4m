# Form events

Each form created by fab4m provides several events that can be used
to be notified about the form lifecycle. We provide events for when data changes,
When data is submitted, and when data is being validated.

## Listen for all data changes

Each time any component in the form changes the `onDataChange` event is fired.
All of the form data is passed to the form as an object.

<Example source={OnChangeExampleSource} example={<OnChangeExample />} />

## Listen for changes in one specific component

You might not want to handle the whole state, and instead only
listen for changes in certain components. This can be done
using the `onComponentChange` event.

### Example

<Example source={OnComponentChangeSource} example={<OnComponentChangeExample />} />

## Handling form submits

Use the `onSubmit` function to handle form submissions. This function is called
whenever the form is submitted and it's only called if the form data is valid,
so you can rely on your data being complete at this point.

### Example

<Example source={SubmitExampleSource} example={<OnSubmitExample />} />

## Using events for custom validation

Sometimes you need to add custom validation for your form, for instance,
if you need to verify that an email doesn't exist, or any other
validation that requires data. You can use the `onPartValidate` event for this.
the `onPartValidate` function is called each timea form part is submitted.

the listener is asynchronous, so any required server validation
can occur within.

Errors encountered should be returned as an array with the following structure:

```jsx
[{
    path: "/component" // <--- This is a JSON pointer,
    message: "This is the message that will be shown in the form"
}];
```

See the validator documentation for more information about validating your data.

:::tip

You can also define custom component validators. This works well when you only need
the data from one specific component, but if you require the data from the full form
you're probably better off using this event instead.
See the documentation on how to create your own component validators.

:::

### Example

The example below performs validation on each of the form parts:
* On part 1, we ensure that the provided age is over 18 and that the name doesn't contain "sam"
* On part 2, We encourage the user to switch profession, if the name provided in part 1 contains "Fabian" and the text "Computer science" is part of the bio.

<Example source={OnPartValidateSource} example={<OnPartValidateForm />} />


## Adding multiple form listeners to the same event

Fab4m forms support multiple event listeners for the same event. By default we override
the registered events when we add any event listener, because you normally add these events
inside of a React component, and we want to provide the current event handler function to avoid weird scope errors.

If you want to use multiple events you can do that by telling the form to append the event:

```jsx
form.onChange(() => {
  // Listener one.
}, true).onChange(() => {
  // Listener two.
}, true)
```
