# Serializing forms

The data structure of a form contains complex objects that can't
be readily serialized. This means it can be complicated to store
a form definition in a JSON storage. In order to remedy that,
fab4m provides a mechanism for serializing and unserializing forms.

## Serializing a form from a definition

Let's say you have the following form definition:

```jsx
const form = createForm({
  name: textField({ label: "Name" }),
  age: integerField({ label: "Age" }),
});
```

You can then serialize your form with the serialize function:

```jsx
const serializedForm = serialize(form);
```

You get an object back that can be safely serialized to a JSON object.

## Unserializing the form

A serialized form can be turned back into a working form definition by unserializing it:

```jsx
const form = unserialize(form);
```
